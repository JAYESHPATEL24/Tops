1. Mounting : 
- constructor(props): use to intialize the state
- static getDrivedStateFromProps(props,state) : called before every render, both on initial mount and subsequent updates. Used to update state based on prop changes.
- render() : the only required method in class compnent
- componentDidMount():call immediatially after mounted


2. Context API:
- context API is used to pass global variables anywhere in the code without the prop drilling. It helps when there is a need for sharing state between a lot of nested components.
- It is light in weight and easier to use, to create a context just need to call React.createContext(). No need to install other dependencies of third party libraries like redux for state management.
