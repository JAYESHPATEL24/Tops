true. 
 
 
 
4. Control Flow (If-Else, Switch)

5. Loops (For, While, Do-While) 
 
 Task 1: 
o Write a JavaScript program using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10. 
 Task 2: 
 
o Create a JavaScript program that uses a while loop to sum all even numbers 
between 1 and 20. 
 Task 3: 
o Write a do-while loop that continues to ask the user for input until they enter a 
number greater than 10. 
 
 
 
6. Functions 
 
 Task 1: 
o Write a function greetUser that accepts a user’s name as a parameter and displays a 
greeting message (e.g., "Hello, John!"). 
 Task 2: 
o Create a JavaScript function calculateSum that takes two numbers as parameters, 
adds them, and returns the result. 
 
 
 
7. Arrays

 Task 2: 
o Create a digital clock that updates every second using setInterval(). 
 
 
 
12. JavaScript Error Handling
