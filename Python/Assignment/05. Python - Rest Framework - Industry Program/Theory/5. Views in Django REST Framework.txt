1) Understanding Views in DRF: Function-based Views vs Class-based Views

- Function-based Views (FBVs):
   - A simpler and more explicit way of defining views.
   - Each view is represented by a Python function.
   - Suitable for simple use cases or small applications.
   - Example:
     from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
     from rest_framework.response import Response

     @api_view(['GET'])
     def get_items(request):
         items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']
         return Response(items)

   - Advantages:
     - Simple and easy to understand.
     - Explicit flow, no hidden behavior.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Can become verbose for larger applications.
     - Limited flexibility for reusability.

- Class-based Views (CBVs):
   - A more flexible and reusable way of defining views.
   - Views are represented by classes that can inherit from built-in views or mixins.
   - Suitable for more complex applications and offers built-in behaviors for common actions like CRUD operations.
   - Example:
     from rest_framework.views import APIView
     from rest_framework.response import Response

     class ItemListView(APIView):
         def get(self, request):
             items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']
             return Response(items)

   - Advantages:
     - Easier to extend and reuse.
     - Built-in methods for common actions (e.g., list, create, update, delete).
     - Promotes better structure in larger applications.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Can feel more complex or over-engineered for simple cases.
     - Implicit behavior that may be harder to understand for beginners.

- Choosing Between FBVs and CBVs:
   - FBVs are good for simple views with minimal functionality.
   - CBVs are better for larger, more complex applications where reusability and maintainability are important.
