What is Serialization?
- Serialization is the process of converting complex data types, such as Django models or Python objects, into a format (like JSON or XML) that can be easily rendered or transmitted over the network.
- It is commonly used in APIs to transform data for front-end or external applications.

Converting Django QuerySets to JSON:
- Django provides a built-in `serialize` method to convert QuerySets into JSON or other formats.
- Example:
  ```python
  from django.core.serializers import serialize
  data = serialize('json', MyModel.objects.all())
  ```
- This JSON can then be sent as a response in a web API.

Using serializers in Django REST Framework (DRF):
- DRF provides a powerful and flexible `Serializer` class to handle serialization and deserialization.
- The `Serializer` class can be used to define how data should be converted to and from JSON.
- Example:
  ```python
  from rest_framework import serializers

  class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
      class Meta:
          model = MyModel
          fields = '__all__'
  ```
- Serializers in DRF make it easy to validate data, define custom fields, and handle nested relationships.
