Set your heart ablaze.
I will leave tomorrow’s problems to tomorrow’s me.
If you don’t take risks, you can’t create a future.
If you don’t like your destiny, don’t accept it. Instead, have the courage to change it the way you want it to be.
Hard work is worthless for those that don’t believe in themselves.
Time doesn’t heal anything, it just teaches us how to live with pain.
People become stronger because they have memories they can’t forget.
Forgetting is like a wound. The wound may heal, but it has already left a scar.
When people are protecting something truly precious to them, they truly can become as strong as they need to be!
It’s not the face that makes someone a monster; it’s the choices they make with their lives.
A person can change, at the moment when the person wishes to change.
You will never be able to love anybody else until you love yourself.
All we can do is live until the day we die. Control what we can...and fly free.
Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is. And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder.
You can die anytime, but living takes true courage.
Don't let failure defeat you. Let it motivate you.
